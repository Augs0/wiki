title: Don't ask to ask your question
---

Just ask your question.

Don't ask "can i ask a question?"

Don't ask "is anyone around?"

Instead, ask your question immediately, in the correct channel.  This is good manners.

Also, try to prepare your question for the best chance of a good answer, and to respect volunteers' time.  See: 
https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask for some advice on this.
